What Is SYS_CRONUS?
This Application was designed to help users download files using their server rather then just going to links 
and having to wait a long time before the download completes, sometimes even resorting to downloading via torrents.
With this script you can download files more then 100X faster then you would directly as its server sided.

All downloads are stored using a zip class liberary. Please note that the zip module must be enabled on your server.
Currently all other archives are not supported. Users can simultaneously use the script as all files are based on server 
sessions, none of the files downloaded are executable via your download folder as they are zipped.

Version 2 will have db users and will list past downloads with suggestions if file is already downloaded to save 
bandwidith. This script is to help you download those files that are too large to store on your P.C.
